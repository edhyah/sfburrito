                Just today, your doctor diagnosed you with a severe case of burrito allergies.
                Apparently you've been having too many burritos. Out of sympathy, your
                doctor suggested you have your last burrito tonight for closure. Now you've
                got to decide ⁠— where are you going to get your last Mission burrito?
