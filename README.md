# Who has the best Mission burrito?

Just a simple webapp where people can vote for what they think is the best
tacqueria that serves Mission burritos in San Francisco.

## Why?

I've gotten in countless debates with friends and non-friends arguing about
which tacqueria is the best. I got frustrated. So here it is.

That said, I also wanted to create the webapp just to see how fast I can develop
it. I did most of the work in two or three days. This also gives me a template
to build more similar (simple) webapps in the future.

## Tech stack

The implementation is just a classic MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)
with TailwindCSS as my front-end framework.
